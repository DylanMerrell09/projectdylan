            <h3>Early Foundations (Pre-1960s)</h3>
            <p>The internet's roots can be traced back to the 1960s, when computer scientists began developing early communication networks. Key developments included the concept of packet switching, which allows data to be broken down into small packets for transmission over various routes, and early research into computer networking.</p>

            <h3>ARPANET (1969)</h3>
            <p>In 1969, ARPANET was established by the U.S. Department of Defense. It was the first operational packet-switching network, and it is widely regarded as the precursor to the modern internet. ARPANET connected four major universities, allowing researchers to share resources and communicate over long distances.</p>

            <h3>The TCP/IP Protocol (1983)</h3>
            <p>The development of the TCP/IP protocol suite in 1983 provided a common language for different networks to communicate with each other. This allowed ARPANET and other networks to interconnect, forming the beginnings of what would become the global internet.</p>

            <p>In the early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web, a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the internet. The creation of web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape allowed the general public to browse the web, leading to the explosive growth of the internet.</p>
